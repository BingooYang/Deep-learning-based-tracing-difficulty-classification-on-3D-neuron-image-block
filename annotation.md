#### Annotation relus

Gold blocks and auto blocks are used to generate labels of 3D image blocks. For an automatic tracing algorithm, the tracing difficulty (low or high) on a 3D image block can be determined according to the similarity between corresponding gold block and auto block. If they are very consistent, the 3D image block is labeled as low tracing difficulty (low-TDB), otherwise as high tracing difficulty (high-TDB).
